        <h1>Corgi Poem</h1>
        <P>In fair Corgi-land, where tails doth wag, A noble breed, in stature not too sag, With fur so soft and eyes so bright, They prance and play in morning's light.</P>
        <p>Yet hidden deep within this playful scene, A message about society, so keen, For in these tiny, loyal hounds we find, A lesson 'bout the human heart and mind.</p>
        <p>In Corgis, unity is plain to see, No prejudice, no bias, only glee, Their colors vary, some with spots or stripes, Yet love and friendship truly are the types.</p>
        <p>In our own world, diversity we prize, Yet sometimes our judgment blinds our eyes, We see the surface, not the soul within, Forgetting that true worth lies deep within.</p>
        <p>Let Corgis teach us, in their charming way, That in our hearts, compassion ought to sway, To judge not by appearances alone, But cherish each unique and precious stone.</p>
        <p>So, when you see a Corgi's happy face, Remember, in this world, we all have a place, And hidden in their playfulness so dear, Lies a message for a society sincere.</p>

        <h1>Why You Should Adopt Me</h1>
        <p>Woof! Well, first of all, corgis like me are irresistibly cute with our short legs, expressive faces, and fluffy tails. But there's more to us than just our looks! We're known for our friendly and affectionate nature. We make excellent companions, always ready to greet you with a wagging tail and a smile. Corgis are also quite intelligent and eager to please, making us relatively easy to train. Our size is perfect for both small apartments and larger homes, so we're adaptable to various living situations. Plus, we're energetic and love to play, which means we can be a fun addition to any family. So, if you're looking for a loving, loyal, and entertaining furry friend, consider bringing a corgi into your life! Woof!</p>
